# ridesharing-services

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Docker (engine >= 19.03.0)
- Git CLI
- GNU Make
- GoLang

### Set up
Open a terminal and type the following commands:
```sh
> git clone https://github.com/baturalpk/ridesharing-services.git

> cd ridesharing-services/

> make up

...
```

### Playing with services
The services are deployed successfully, so what's next?<br>
> 🏌️ It's definitely time to play with them...

*It's assumed that the terminal is still in project's root directory:*
```sh
...

> cd client-app/

> go run .
```

If all is well, the client app would be running on your terminal screen. Profit! ✨
